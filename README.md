# NiceRAT

NiceRAT is an easy-to-use, Python-based RAT, which send info to your webhook.
You can recover passwords, aplication data, discord info and much more.

It is great for unrestricted access to desktop devices, enabling discreet exploration of applications and files while bypassing typical security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and authentication controls.

NiceRAT is available as [Premium Version](https://t.me/NicestRAT) or [Free Version](https://github.com/0x00G/nicerat) on Github.

## Why?



We at NiceRAT specialize in developing cutting-edge remote access trojan (RAT) software solutions that prioritize both functionality and security. While existing platforms such as Pegasus have set a high standard in this domain, we recognized the need for a more tailored approach to meet the evolving demands of our clientele.

By harnessing the power of Vue, Quasar, and FastAPI, we empower our clients with a comprehensive solution that delivers unparalleled functionality, security, and performance in the realm of remote trojan software.
